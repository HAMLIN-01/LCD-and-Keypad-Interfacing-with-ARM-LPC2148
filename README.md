# LCD-and-Keypad-Interfacing-with-ARM-LPC2148
This project demonstrates how to interface a 16x2 LCD and a 4x4 keypad with the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller. The keypad is used to input characters or numbers, which are then displayed on the LCD. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
# Features
Reads input from a 4x4 matrix keypad.
Displays the pressed key on a 16x2 LCD.
Efficient GPIO handling for keypad scanning and LCD control.
Can be extended for password-based authentication or menu navigation.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: LPC2148 (ARM7),
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: Keil uVision,
Simulation Software: Proteus.
# How It Works
The keypad is connected to GPIO pins of the LPC2148 microcontroller.
The microcontroller scans the keypad to detect key presses.
The corresponding key is displayed on the 16x2 LCD in real time.
