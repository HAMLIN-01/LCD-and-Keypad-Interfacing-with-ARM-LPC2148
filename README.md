# LCD-and-Keypad-Interfacing-with-ARM-LPC2148
This project demonstrates how to interface a 16x2 LCD and a 4x4 keypad with the LPC2148 ARM microcontroller. The keypad is used to input characters or numbers, which are then displayed on the LCD. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil uVision IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
